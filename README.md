# 💰 Pricing Plans

Welcome to the Pricing Plans project! This is a simple React application that displays different pricing plans using customizable components.

## 🌟 Project Description

This project showcases a set of pricing plans, each with its own set of features. It's built using React and demonstrates the use of reusable components to create a dynamic and responsive UI.


The project consists of two main components:

1. **App Component**: This component is the main entry point of the application. It renders the pricing plans by mapping through the `plans` array and passing the data to the `PriceCard` component.
   
2. **PriceCard Component**: This component represents a single pricing card. It receives props such as name, price, and features, and renders them accordingly.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for the components.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive grid layout and styling.

### 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Pricing Cards**: The pricing plans are displayed using reusable components.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
